Difficulty: Easy

---

Say you have an array for which the i<sup>th</sup> element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of <br>the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

#### Example 1:

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [7,1,5,3,6,4]
<b>Output:</b> 5
<b>Explanation:</b> Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
</pre>

#### Example 2:

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [7,6,4,3,1]
<b>Output:</b> 0
<b>Explanation:</b> In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
</pre>
