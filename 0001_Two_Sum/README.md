https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

Difficulty: Easy

---

Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have ***exactly*** one solution, and you may not use the *same* element twice.

#### Example:

<pre>
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[<b>0</b>] + nums[<b>1</b>] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [<b>0, 1</b>].
</pre>
