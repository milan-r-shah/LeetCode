Difficulty: Easy

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `char[]`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)<br>with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of [printable ascii characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).

#### Example 1:

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> ["h","e","l","l","o"]
<b>Output:</b> ["o","l","l","e","h"]
</pre>

#### Example 2:

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
<b>Output:</b> ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
</pre>
