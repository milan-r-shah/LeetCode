Implement ```int sqrt(int x)```.

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

#### Example 2:

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 8
<b>Output:</b> 2
